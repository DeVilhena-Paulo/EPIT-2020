# Day 3: Cubical and simplicial models of HoTT

Lecturer: Christian Sattler

## Overview and prerequisites

We will give an introduction to simplicial and cubical models of homotopy type theory.
We asume basic familiarity with category theory (e.g., universal properties, adjunctions, Yoneda lemma).

You do not have to be familiar with models of type theory or simplicial or cubical sets, although it will make some lectures easier to follow.

## Schedule

The online lectures will take place 14:00â€“18:30 on Wednesday, April 14, 2021.
All times are in UTC+2.

Full schedule to be announced.
