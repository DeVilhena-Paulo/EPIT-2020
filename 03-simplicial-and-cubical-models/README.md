# Day 3: Cubical and simplicial models of HoTT

Lecturer: Christian Sattler

## Overview and prerequisites

We will give an introduction to simplicial and cubical models of homotopy type theory.
We asume basic familiarity with category theory (e.g., universal properties, adjunctions, Yoneda lemma).

You do not have to be familiar with models of type theory or simplicial or cubical sets, although it will make some lectures easier to follow.

## Schedule

The online lectures will take place 14:00–18:30 on Wednesday, April 14, 2021.
All times are in UTC+2.

*The above is a rough schedule. If we run overtime in the lectures, we will shorten the exercise sessions.*

Due to the tight schedule, we might have to skip over some aspects.
We can certainly not go into all the details.
I will be available 10:00–13:00 on Tuesday on Discord for in-depth discussions.

## Contents

Lecture notes will be made available before the lectures.

### Introduction

* Overview of existing models
* Connections with ∞-toposes

### Part 1: What is a model of type theory?

* Category of contexts and substitutions
* Presheaves and discrete fibrations
* Our notion of model: categories with families
* Contextuality/democracy
* Algebraicity vs. categoricity
* Types and display maps
* Type formers:
  - `Σ`/`Π`-types via adjoints to substitution on types
  - `Id`-types via lifting
  - Universe `U` via reflection
* Examples: sets, groupoids

### Part 2: Presheaf models

* `Π`-types (via coreflection)
* Hofmann-Streicher universe (via coreflection)
* Type formers internally to presheaves over contexts
* Presheaf models as bootstrappers for simplicial/cubical models

### Part 3: The simplicial model of HoTT

* Simplicial sets
* Homotopical structure on simplicial sets
* Weak factorization systems
* Pushout/pullback constructions
* Interpretation of HoTT
* Constructivity problems

### Part 4: Cubical models and open questions

* Cubical models:
  - the connection approach
  - the Cartesian approach
* Right adjoint to exponentiation with interval
* Construction from extensional model with dependent right adjoint
* Open questions
